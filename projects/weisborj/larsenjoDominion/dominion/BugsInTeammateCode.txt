BUG 1: I found this bug within larsenjo’s dominion.c implementation (larsenjo-assignment-4).
The bug is on line 701 within the function smith() which is called by  cardEffect().
The card “smithy”, once bought is supposed to draw 3 cards and then be discarded.
However in smith(), the for loop runs 4 times and calls drawCard() 4 times before discarding Smithy.
I found this bug while refactoring my tests to work with larsenjo’s implementation.
I would recommend changing line 701 to “for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)”
BUG 2: The second bug that I found was in the advent() function of dominion.c.
This function is supposed to accurately implement the adventurer card.
When Adventurer is played, you reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal 2 treasure cards and then the rest of the cards are discarded.
However in advent(), the function incorrectly reveals cards until 4 treasure cards are revealed not 2.
I found this bug while running my “randomtestcard1.c” which tests Adventurer.
Inside check_adventurer_effect, my test breaks after 2 treasurer cards are revealed however my test makes the player play adventurer which will call advent(),
then the person will draw 4 treasure cards so when I compare states, it will seg fault.
I would recommend changing line 665 to “while(drawntreasure<4).”
